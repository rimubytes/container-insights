# Learning Containers

This repository is dedicated to exploring the intricacies of container technologies, diving deep into concepts such as resource management, networking, namespaces, and more. Through practical examples and detailed explanations, it aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of how containers work under the hood.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several subdirectories, each focusing on a specific aspect of container technology:

- `cgroups/`: Demonstrates the use of Linux cgroups (control groups) for resource management, such as limiting CPU and memory usage for processes.
- `netns/`: Explores network namespaces, allowing isolated networking environments within the same host.
- `mount/`: Examines the mount namespace, providing insights into file system isolation for containers.
- `userns/`: Delves into user namespaces, enabling user and group ID remapping for enhanced security.

Each directory contains detailed code examples and explanations of the concepts being demonstrated.
